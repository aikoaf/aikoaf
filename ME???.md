- ✨ A little something about me: I love staying up extremely late to the point where I pass out at my desk.
- 💻 What do I do? **Well, I am a Developer at <ins>Team Gravity</ins>**. There I code in Ren'Py. But I also code webpages for funsies.
- 🖥️ Woah another computer, what could this mean? `I love to mess with Linux.` My parents used to hate it, I would change the operating system on our computers all the time. I started with Ubuntu but then would install Arch Linux and Gentoo for the fun of it, I guess I liked to torture myself xD.
- 🐶 I have 4 dogs. Their names are Leilani, Gracie, Ariel, and Cooper. *Cooper is last because he's annoying.*
- 😸 I also have 2 cats. Their names are Boots and Frisky, they are brothers, and they are the sweetest kitties ever.
