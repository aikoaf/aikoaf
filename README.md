- 👋 Hi, I’m @aikoaf
- 👀 I’m interested in `Science, Computers, and Piloting`
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `programming like websites and javascript, also a little bit of science`
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on `mostly webpages, etc.`
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord `@a1k0.af` or Email `aikoaf@astromc.co`
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have flown a Cessna from Destin Airport to Panama City Beach!
- ✨ A little something about me: I love staying up extremely late to the point where I pass out at my desk.
- 💻 What do I do? **Well, I am a Developer at <ins>Team Gravity</ins>**. There I code in Ren'Py. But I also code webpages for funsies.
- 🖥️ Woah another computer, what could this mean? `I love to mess with Linux.` My parents used to hate it, I would change the operating system on our computers all the time. I started with Ubuntu but then would install Arch Linux and Gentoo for the fun of it, I guess I liked to torture myself xD.
- 🐶 I have 4 dogs. Their names are Leilani, Gracie, Ariel, and Cooper. *Cooper is last because he's annoying.*
- 😸 I also have 2 cats. Their names are Boots and Frisky, they are brothers, and they are the sweetest kitties ever.
